# BMI Calculator

A simple Python-based BMI Calculator that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. This application provides an easy way to determine if an individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on BMI values.

## Features

- Calculate BMI using weight (in kg) and height (in meters).
- Display BMI results with corresponding weight categories (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
- Simple, easy-to-use console-based interface.
